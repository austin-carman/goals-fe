# Goal Tracker (frontend repo)

The motivation behind this project is 3 fold:
1. `Practice`, practice, practice.
2. Seek `advice` to improve my coding skills and meeting best coding practices. I want to learn from you!
4. Learn about possible `job opportunities`. I am actively seeking job opportunities and if you are aware of any I would love to hear from you!

## Overview

This application allows users to store their goals and easily track progress with each goal. After creating an account, users can login and view all their goals which are organized into 3 categories: all, completed, and in progress. Users can create, edit, or delete a goal with steps, notes, and completion status.
