# Goal Tracker (frontend repo)

This Goal Tracker app allows users to store all their goals in one place and to easily track progress with each goal. Break goals down into manageable steps with notes and completion status to help keep your goals well organized. Toggle the display to see what goals you've already accomplished and which goals are still a work in progress.

This app was designed to help users keep their goals easily accessible and organized so they can keep them in mind, come up with a plan to achieve their goal, and track their progress.
